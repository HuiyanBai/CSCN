## Abstract
Extracting discriminative information from complex spectral details in hyperspectral image (HSI) for HSI classification is pivotal. While current prevailing methods rely on spectral magnitude features, they could cause confusion in certain classes, resulting in misclassification and decreased accuracy. We find that the derivative spectrum proves more adept at capturing concealed information, thereby offering a distinct advantage in separating these confusion classes. Leveraging the complementarity between spectral magnitude and derivative features, we propose a content-driven spectrum complementary network (CSCN) based on magnitude-derivative dual encoder, employing these two features as combined inputs. To fully utilize their complementary information, we raise a content-adaptive pointwise fusion module (CPFM), enabling adaptive fusion of dual-encoder features in a pointwise selective manner, contingent upon feature representation. To preserve a rich source of complementary information while extracting more distinguishable features, we introduce a hybrid disparity-enhancing loss that enhances the differential expression of the features from the two branches and increases the interclass distance. As a result, our method achieves state-of-the-art results on the extensive WHU-OHS dataset and eight other benchmark datasets.
